 * THE STORY SO FAR *


In the year 3035, the human race has expanded its dominion to all the inner
planets of the solar system.
But in the underground of the planet Uranus lives an hostile race: the zorxians.
When the first human ship reached for Uranus they discovered that these aliens
are preparing for war.
And so, there was a big war. It was fought mainly between Jupiter and Saturn,
but in the last years the humans were in great difficulty.

The last hope of survival was destroying Xzarna, the queen of the zorxians.

For this purpose the humans built 50 super space ships, and sent them to Uranus,
to accomplish this desperate mission.
Those pilots fought bravely, but the opposition was great, and they never
reached Uranus. Only 1 of this super ships managed to come back to Earth,
unnoticed by the zorxians.

The war was almost lost, and the zorxian fleet was reaching the Earth without
encountering too much resistence.
Xzarna, believing that the victory was near, went with the zorxian fleet too.
This gave a last hope to the humans: they sent all the remainig forces to
distract the fleet, while the last super ship made the final assault to
Xzarna and her escort.

In this game you are the pilot of the human super ship, and you'll have to
fight your way through waves of aliens spaceship, until the giant spaceship
of Xzarna, where you will fight the final battle.
