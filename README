  Alienwave -- A game by Alessandro Pira

This is a game I wrote in my free time, using ncurses.
I tested it only on i586 linux, but it should run without problems on
every *NIX system.

To compile you need the ncurses library (all linux distrib. come with it)
and you should just type "make; make clean".
The file alienwave will be crated. You can copy it in your /usr/games
directory, or wherever you want.

The game is simple... just fire to everything that moves and avoid being
hit. :-)
If you want, you can read the file STORY where you will find a little
background for the game.
The keys are:

Left arrow, right arrow: move your ship
Down arrow: stop your ship
Enter, Space: fire lasers
S, Backspace, Up arrow: open shields (if the charge is enough)
Shift+p, p: pause the game (press any key to resume)
Shift+q, ESC: quit game in any moment

In the upper left corner you can see the charge indicator of the shields. If
it's empty you cannot raise them. When it starts charging you can open the
shields... the will last more if the charge is high.
Beware that the shields won't move... they will stay where you placed them!

In the upper right corner you can see your score.
If your score is high enough you can encounter Xzarna (see STORY). 
Write me if you manage to destroy her :-)
